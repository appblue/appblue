- Hi! My name is Krzysztof Kielak
- I’m interested in data processing and analysis pipelines using:
  - Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter notebooks
  - Julia with DataFrames, Pluto notebooks etc.
  - FSharp (F#) with FSharp.Data and all .NET Core ecosystem, and AWS automation via AWSSDK for .NET
  - Clojure in the context of AWS automation via AWSSDK for Java
- I’m currently still learning all of the above tools while doing my day to day job
- I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to HPC and potentially involving above technologies
- You can reach me at krzysztof.kielak@gmail.com
