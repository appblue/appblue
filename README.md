Hi! My name is Krzysztof Kielak

I’m interested in data processing and analysis pipelines using:
- Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter notebooks
- Julia with DataFrames, Pluto notebooks etc.
- FSharp (F#) with FSharp.Data and all .NET Core ecosystem, and AWS automation via AWSSDK for .NET
- Clojure in the context of AWS automation via AWSSDK for Java
