Hi!

I’m interested in data processing and analysis pipelines using:
- FSharp (F#) with FSharp.Data and all .NET Core ecosystem, and AWS automation via AWSSDK for .NET
- Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter notebooks
- Data wrangling and processing with Julia with DataFrames, Pluto notebooks etc.
- Clojure in the context of AWS automation via AWSSDK for Java
